                <h3>Summary: </h3> 
                <p>"The millions of readers of Amor Towles are in 
                    for a treat as he shares some of his shorter fiction: <br> 
                    six stories set in New York City and a novella in Los Angeles. <br>
                    The New York stories, most of which are set around 
                    the turn of the millennium, <br>take up everything from 
                    the death-defying acrobatics of the male ego, to 
                    the fateful consequences of brief encounters, <br>and 
                    the delicate mechanics of comprise which operate 
                    at the heart of modern marriages. In Towles's novel, 
                    Rules of Civility, <br>the indomitable Evelyn Ross leaves 
                    New York City in September, 1938, with the intention 
                    of returning home to Indiana. <br>But as her train pulls 
                    into Chicago, where her parents are waiting, she 
                    instead extends her ticket to Los Angeles. <br>Told from 
                    seven points of view, "Eve in Hollywood" describes 
                    how Eve crafts a new future for herself-and others-in 
                    the midst of Hollywood's golden age. <br>Throughout the 
                    stories, two characters often find themselves sitting 
                    across a table for two where the direction of their 
                    futures may hinge <br>upon what they say to each other 
                    next. Written with his signature wit, humor, and 
                    sophistication, <br>Table for Two is another glittering 
                    addition to Towles's canon of stylish and 
                    transporting historical fiction"</p>
